### Dry Questions

---

##### Question 1

The class used to implement the controller pattern, is the `SnappingSheetController` Class.

It is used to snap a SnappingSheet to a specific position, stop the snapping, and get information from the sheet such as the `currentPosition`, `currentSnappingPosition`, `CurrentlySnapping` and `isAttached`.


##### Question 2

The parameter that controls this behavior is `snappingCurve` which gets a `Curve` and uses that animation to snap into position.

```python

```


##### Question 3

`GestureDetector` provides the developer with more controller (such as dragging) while `InkWell` has a ripple effect when clicking it.
